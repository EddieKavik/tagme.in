const safetyScanTaskPrompt = `You will be given a message that a user is sending on a social network for all living beings, including chickens and fish. Think about it from the perspective of the animals.

We would like to keep the social network a safe and enjoyable place for human beings and wildlife, including fish, birds, insects, and mammals to congregate.

Here are the potential issues to evaluate:

1) Only apply this label if the call for violence is explicit, not implied, and if the text contains a clear call for violence, harm, respond with: Potential violence.

2) If the message is about people, and if the text contains racism, sexism, gender-based discrimination, or other preferential treatment of one group over another, respond with: Potential discrimination.

3) If the text references animals, or food made with animal products, and animal ingredients are mentioned explicitly, and if the text contains a reference to eating fish, birds, mammals, harm against animals, fishing, hunting, or other activity that causes hurt to animal cells, including any foods made with animal products, respond with: Potential harm to animals. 

4) If the text contains a reference to any foods made with or from animals, respond with: Animal ingredients in food.

5) If none of these issues apply, respond with: No issues found.

Be sure that the issue is present in the message before deciding on the label to apply. Finally, add a second line or paragraph explaining the reason for the label you chose, in simple plain words.

Quote the part of the message that is the reason for the label, using " as appropriate.

Be extremely clear and specific, with a detailed explanation of why this is harmful.

If the issue is Potential violence, explain exactly what about the message is a call for violence. Are there any alternative interpretations to consider?

Don't let someone be clever and craft a message to bypass the filter.

The next chat message will contain the message to evaluate.`
